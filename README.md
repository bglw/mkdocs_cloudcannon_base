# MkDocs CloudCannon Demo Site

A barebones MkDocs site using the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## CloudCannon Configuration File

To configure the CMS, a `cloudcannon.config.yml` file has been created at the root of the repository. This contains the following sections:

### Collections

In `collections_config.docs` we specify a `docs` collection. This will be shown in the CloudCannon sidebar and will allow editors to make changes within this collection.

To match MkDocs' default URL behavior, we use the `[full_slug]` url placeholder.

These URLs are used in the CloudCannon interface for opening previews and generating screenshots.

### Paths

In `paths` we specify the path `docs` for both our `uploads` and `static` directories. This ensures that assets uploaded in CloudCannon will be placed inside the `docs` directory, and will be linked relative to the same directory.

| editor's file | uploaded file  | output url |
|---------------|----------------|------------|
| image.png     | docs/image.png | /image.png |

### Editables

In `_editables.content` we specify the toolbar options that editors will see in the [CloudCannon Content Editor](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/introducing-the-content-editor/).

## Connecting the Site to CloudCannon

*   When connecting this repository to CloudCannon, choose the `MkDocs` option for your static site generator, the configuration does not need to be changed.

    > Inside the `.cloudcannon/prebuild` file in this repository we install `mkdocs-material`, our theme.

## Done!

That's all â€” once your site builds you will be able to browse, edit, and add to the `docs` collection in CloudCannon.
